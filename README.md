A Notebook that Find Donors to ML Charity .


## Project Overview:

In this Notebook, I will apply supervised learning techniques and an analytical mind on data collected for the U.S. census to help CharityML (a fictitious charity organization) identify people most likely to donate to their cause. I will first explore the data to learn how the census data is recorded. Next, I will apply a series of transformations and preprocessing techniques to manipulate the data into a workable format. I will then evaluate several supervised learners of my choice on the data, and consider which is best suited for the solution. Afterwards, I will optimize the model I've selected and present it as my solution to CharityML. Finally, I will explore the chosen model and its predictions under the hood, to see just how well it's performing when considering the data it's given.
